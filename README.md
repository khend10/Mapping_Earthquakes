# Mapping_Earthquakes
The purpose of this project is to create visuals using Javascript and Leaflet to document earthquake data around the world. Data was sourced using GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website to retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days.
